# Tinder-Bot

## Technologies Used: Python

### PURPOSE: This is a tinder bot that can automate the use of the dating application called "Tinder" to help you find love. The bot can login to tinder, swipe right or left randomly, & clear all popups to get you matches continuously. The "auto_swipe" function swipes every second & it has a counter that prints out each second it is running, thus outputing the seconds on the terminal. The auto_swipe function goes non stop until 2700 seconds (45 minutes). You may need to sign up to "tinder plus" in order to get unlimited matches so the bot can last the full 45 minutes.
